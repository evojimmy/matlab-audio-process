matlab-audio-process
====================

Apply Short Time Fourier Transform to audio signal, and apply frequency-domain transform to the signal:

+ Extract four peaks with greatest magnitude
+ Randomize the phase

To start, edit parameters in `script.m` and run it.

Octave compatible, although it seems octave is much slower than MATLAB (?)
